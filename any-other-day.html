        Created for an assignment during my first year of uni, <b><i>Any Other Day</i></b> marks my first attempt to explore different styles of filmmaking and storytelling. Featuring my Dad <b><i>John Farry Sr</i></b>, this film portrays his daily pre-work routine. Opening with a staple alarm clock shot, we watch as he performs mundane tasks such as making his bed and putting his work uniform on. There is a melancholie within his acting however that I personally feel adds a tender touch to the piece. The visuals are also accompanied by a monologue written and performed by my Dad, that outlines his outlook on his work. His words are admittedly made to feel a lot more melodramatic, as his feelings in regards to work are a lot more optimistic and hopeful, but we both agreed to exaggerate everything a bit for the film.
